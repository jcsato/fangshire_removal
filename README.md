## Features

The supporter edition of Battle Brothers includes a DLC that gives players the "Fangshire", a Legendary helmet with modest stats, automatically at the start of every campaign. While the Fangshire is not particularly powerful, it is a free helmet with good enough stats for the early game; as such, it can feel "cheaty" to use. Players can't simply get rid of it in a straightforward way either; selling it gives gold, which presents its own early game boost (although, again, a quite minor one). The only truly "neutral" option to dispose of it is to turn off auto-loot and remember to remove it from the stash after a battle, which is obnoxious and finnicky.

At the same time, simply disabling the DLC entirely presents its own issues, as this prevents saves made with the DLC active from being loaded.

This mod prevents the Fangshire from being added to the player's inventory while leaving the DLC active, allowing saves to be loaded but removing the boost granted by the item.

As a bonus, of sorts, the Fangshire is added to the camp loot of Hoggart's Refuge in the "Rebuilding a Company" tutorial origin's starting contract. This felt like a more immersive, rewarding way to get the helmet and a good compromise to keep the helmet around for newer players who are more likely to want the helmet.
